# Topic : An Analysis of Food Security in USA - 2021

***

#### Our teamâ€™s research topic is the situation of food security in 2021.  We want to know how different demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to food security. 

*We are using the Current Population Survey - Food Security Supplement Dec 2021 data provided by the US Census Bureau*

*The Dataset contains 507 variables and roughly 120,000 observations*

*** 

##### The Smart Question we have proposed and hope to answer are

**Specific**:- To study the specific pattern shown in the data that affects food security such as states, counties, income level, whether the family uses SNAP, race, immigrant status, work status, education level and many more demographic, socio-economic variables.  

**Measurable**: Use EDA techniques to know how significantly different factors contribute to food insecurity.  

**Achievable**: Can find variables which are significantly affecting food insecurity and can create models for ensuring food security in households.  

**Relevant**: Food being the basic requirement of any human, this study can shed light on what the authorities and we ourselves can do in order to eradicate food insecurity.  

**Time-oriented**: Data set for the month of December 2021 is considered for the study so that it can also show the effect of Covid-19 in food security.  

*** 

*Considering the Questions we are asking, we have decided to select just 11 factors to work on* 

*A very significant limitation to our data is that we have trimmed off a lot of observations where either the interview was not taken or not completed.  Ideally we should account for these observations somehow, but due to time constraints we aren't doing that*

## Converting the all the columns to factors as they are all ordinal(except the Id, but since it's categorical i'm converting it into a factor too)


FS_Subset[] <- lapply( FS_Subset, factor)

str(FS_Subset)
```


**Coming to our Response Variable, Food Security** 

***
  
**High Food Security**:  No reported indications of food-access problems or limitations.


**Marginal Food Security**:  One or two reported signs, usually anxiety over food availability or scarcity in the home. There is little to no evidence that diets or food intake have changed.  

**Low Food Security**:  One or two reported signs, usually indicating worry about food scarcity or insufficiency at home. Little to no evidence of dietary or food intake changes.  

**Very Low Food Security**:  Reports of numerous signs of altered eating habits and decreased food intake.

```

Here 
* 1 High Food Security
* 2 Marginal Food Security 
* 3 Low Food Security
* 4 Very Low Food Security
* -9 No Response


In the above graphs, people say that they have High Food Security irrespective of the number of jobs. But lets use Chi-Square test to see if they are really independent of each other

```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
food_num <- droplevels(subset(food_ave, Number_of_Jobs != "Not Applicable" ))
str(food_num)
```

```{r, results='markup', warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
str(food_noj)
```

```{r, results='markup',warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
contable_number_of_jobs <- table(food_num$Number_of_Jobs, food_num$FoodSecurity_score)
xkabledply(contable_number_of_jobs)

## Chi-Square Test 
chi_test <- chisq.test(contable_number_of_jobs, correct = F)
chi_test
```

The result gave warnings as the estimated value for some cells are very low.
From the test, we see that the P-value for the Chi-square test is 0.3871 which is greater than the default value 0.05. Hence we accept the null hypothesis and hence, Number of Jobs doesn't significantly affect the Food Security.


###Education Level

```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
food_edu <- droplevels(subset(food_ave, Education_Level != "Not Applicable" ))
str(food_edu)
edu_freq <- as.data.frame(table(food_edu$Education_Level))
edu_freq
```

```{r , results='markup', echo=FALSE}
plot(food_edu$Education_Level)
ggplot(food_edu) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Education_Level, fill = FoodSecurity_score), position = "dodge") +
  xlab("Jobs") + ylab("Count")

ggplot(food_edu, aes(x = Education_Level, fill = FoodSecurity_score)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + labs( x = " " , y = " ", title = "Food Security Score on Education Level")

## Plotting barcharts between all the levels of state and food security status

Reference to household income:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
income_t <- table(FS_Subset$Household_Income, FS_Subset$FoodSecurity_score)

```
We can say that Household income is affecting food insecurity. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
family_t <- table(FS_Subset$Family_Size, FS_Subset$FoodSecurity_score)
chisq.test(family_t)
```
We can say that Family size is affecting food insecurity. 

```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}

boxplot(FoodSecurity_score ~ Family_Size, data = food_una, col=c("blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange"), main="Family size - Food security")
boxplot(FoodSecurity_score ~ Household_Income, data = food_una, col=c("blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange"), main="Household Income - Food security")
boxplot(FoodSecurity_score ~ States, data = food_una, col=c("blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange"))

```
As you can see from the boxplot, whenever family size bigger (more than 6 people), food insecurity is high. 
Also, household income has direct effect on food security. When household income is higher than 40k, food security score is low.
